## Your Turn: Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Run the Deployment Script

```bash
cd /Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing
./DEPLOY.sh
```

**What will happen:**
1. Script will check if you're logged in to Vercel
2. If not, it will open login in your browser
3. You'll log in with email or GitHub (free account)
4. Script will automatically deploy your landing page
5. You'll get a URL like: `https://survey-landing.vercel.app`

**Total time:** 2-3 minutes

---

### Step 2: Share the URL with Me

Once deployed, **copy the Vercel URL** and share it with me.

I'll then:
1. ✅ Verify the domain in Resend
2. ✅ Update email sender in your code
3. ✅ Test that emails work for all users
4. ✅ Redeploy functions with new sender

**That's it! Emails will work for everyone.**
