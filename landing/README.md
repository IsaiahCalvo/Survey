# Your Landing Page

Your landing page was deployed at one of these URLs:
- https://landing-ogvi6hujo-isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects.vercel.app
- https://landing-41vj4d8fh-isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects.vercel.app
- https://landing-2zvtpwo7t-isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects.vercel.app

## Note about survey-app.vercel.app

`survey-app.vercel.app` is owned by someone else (International Medical University Malaysia).

You do NOT own:
- `survey-app.vercel.app` (belongs to Malaysian university)
- `survey-app.app` (you said you made this up)
- `surveytool.app` (you said you made this up)

## Your Actual Landing Page

To find your actual URL, go to:
https://vercel.com/isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects

And check the "landing" project to see the production URL.

## For Now

I'll update the email templates to just say "Download Survey App" without a specific URL link, since you have a desktop app, not a web app.
