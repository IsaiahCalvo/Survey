# Simple Solution - Get survey-app.vercel.app

## The Issue

Your Vercel project is named "landing" which gives you URLs like:
- `landing-xxxxx-isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects.vercel.app` (long)

We want: `survey-app.vercel.app` (simple)

## Solution: Rename Project in Dashboard (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Vercel Dashboard

Go to: https://vercel.com/isaiahcalvo123-5536s-projects/landing

### Step 2: Rename Project

1. Click **Settings** tab
2. In the left sidebar, click **General**
3. Scroll down to "Project Name"
4. Click the **Edit** button
5. Change from `landing` to `survey-app`
6. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Get Your New URL

Your landing page will now be at:
**https://survey-app.vercel.app**

(The old URLs will redirect automatically)

### Step 4: Tell Me When Done

Once you've renamed it, tell me and I'll:
1. ✅ Verify `survey-app.vercel.app` in Resend
2. ✅ Update email sender to `noreply@survey-app.vercel.app`
3. ✅ Redeploy functions
4. ✅ Test emails work for everyone!

## Can't Access Dashboard?

If you can't access the dashboard, I can use a workaround:
- Verify the current long domain in Resend
- Emails will work, just with a longer sender address

Let me know which you prefer!
