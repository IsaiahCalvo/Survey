## Next Step: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

I've installed Vercel CLI for you. Now you need to deploy:

### Option 1: I'll Guide You Through It (Recommended)

Run this command:
```bash
cd /Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing
vercel
```

**You'll be prompted:**

1. **"Set up and deploy?"** → Press `Y` (yes)

2. **"Which scope?"** → Choose your account or create new

3. **"Link to existing project?"** → Press `N` (no, it's a new project)

4. **"Project name?"** → Press Enter (accepts "landing" as default) or type "survey-landing"

5. **"In which directory?"** → Press Enter (current directory is correct)

6. **"Override settings?"** → Press `N` (no)

**That's it!** Vercel will:
- Deploy your landing page
- Give you a URL like: `https://survey-landing.vercel.app`
- Set up automatic deployments for future updates

### Option 2: Quick Deploy Without Prompts

Run:
```bash
cd /Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing
vercel --prod --yes
```

This auto-confirms all prompts and deploys directly to production.

## After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll get a URL like:
`https://survey-landing-xxxx.vercel.app` or `https://survey-landing.vercel.app`

**Share this URL with me** and I'll:
1. Verify the domain in Resend
2. Update your email sender from `onboarding@resend.dev` to `noreply@survey-landing.vercel.app`
3. Test that emails work for all users

---

## Future Updates

To update the landing page later:

1. Edit files in `/Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing/`
2. Run: `cd /Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing && vercel --prod`
3. New version deploys automatically

---

## Customization Ideas (For Later)

You can customize the landing page by editing:
- `index.html` - Change text, features, pricing
- `styles.css` - Change colors, fonts, layout

Some ideas:
- Add screenshots of the app
- Add testimonials from users
- Add video demo
- Link to documentation
- Add contact form

## Ready to Deploy?

1. Run: `cd /Users/isaiahcalvo/Desktop/Survey/landing && vercel`
2. Follow the prompts
3. Share the URL with me
4. I'll complete the email setup!

**Let me know when it's deployed!** 🚀
